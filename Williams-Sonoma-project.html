                        <h3>The Opportunity:</h3>
                        <p>Williams-Sonoma is an upscale chain offering high-end cookware, house-label kitchen accessories and gourmet goods. They are aspiring to build a superior relationship with their customers by giving them an experience beyond kitchen products they purchase. Their current website has poor navigation which prevents users' from finding relevant information.</p>
                        <h3>My Solution:</h3>
                        <p>My goal was to streamline the site navigation and attract users by allowing them to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Easily find new culinary skills and top-quality products.</li>
                                <li>Search and book cooking classes in their city.</li>
                                <li>Provide a social platform to communicate and share ideas and recipes with other cooks.</li>
                            </ul>

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <h4>Organizational Research</h4>
                    <p>I started learning more about Williams-Sonoma's founding and corporate values that guides their actions and decisions. I found their mission is to enhance the quality of their customers’ lives at home. From their people to their products, quality is their signature. Williams-Sonoma has a great range of top quality products and lot of useful information.</p>
                    <p><b>Unfortunately, their poorly designed website frustrates users and prevents them from finding what they are looking for and they turn elsewhere.</b></p>
            
                    <h4>Domain and User Research</h4>
                    <p>For better understanding of the market, I prepared a competitive and comparative analysis of Williams-Sonoma and its competitors. I studied similar kitchen stores, other cooking classes and online retailers to understand the different opportunities available to the users in the existing market.</p>
                    <p>I also performed Neilsen heuristic evaluation and task analysis of Williams-Sonoma's current website and its competitors' websites to evaluate their usability.</p>
                    <h4>User Interviews</h4>
                    <p>I screened 20 people, out of which I interviewed 8 participants(on phone and in person) to study 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Their desires and frustrations when purchasing kitchen products online or in-store.</li>
                            <li>Their interest in cooking and what would motivate them to take cooking classes.</li>
                            <li>The relationship they would like to build with stores like Williams-Sonoma.</li>
                        </ul></p>

                            <li>People are cooking more at home.</li>
                            <li>They want to make interesting and healthy food.</li>
                            <li><b>They want to understand the cooking process and techniques better.</b></li>
                            <li>Their main source of information is online videos, TV shows and cook books.</li>
                            <li><b>They would like more exposure to seasoned cooks and learn smart tips.</b></li>
                            <li>More men are cooking and likely to buy high end kitchen tools (or gadgets ?!)</li>
                            <li><b>They prefer shopping online because it’s convenient, has reliable customer reviews and good return policies.</b></li>
                            <li>They find the staff in stores lack enough knowledge that will help them make wise choices.</li>
                            <li><b>They would prefer physically seeing the product before buying it.</b></li>

                    <h4>Proto-persona</h4>

                    <h4>Who is it for?</h4>
                    <p>Jeff Smith is a serious amateur cook who loves to recreate food that inspires him. He is willing to spend money on big ticket items as long as their value is justified by utility.</p>
                    <h4>Why build it?</h4>
                    <p>Jeff loved the sushi he had eaten at one of the best restaurants in Seattle. He wants to recreate that experience for his friends at home. After an extensive online research, he is overwhelmed with all the information he finds and cannot tell quality content from weaker ones. Jeff finds sushi making classes at Williams-Sonoma. They have provided precise information on the classes web page and helpful reviews by previous customers that supports his decision to take the class. After taking the class, Jeff feels confident about implementing his newly acquired culinary skills at home and wow his friends.</p>
                    <p>Williams-Sonoma not only satisfied his culinary goals but exceeded his expectations and added value to his lifestyle. </p>

                    <h3>Design Framework and Sketches</h3>
                    <p>Williams-Sonoma's current website makes it difficult for users to find cooking class information. It has too many options and menu bars on the home page confusing the user with the navigation. My goal was to bring clarity and discipline to the website's structure and user flows.
                    </p>
                    <p>I used card sorting to start building the website structure which led to concept maps. Concept map helped me organize and connect different segments of the website. This formed the basis of a site map which allowed me to visually categorize the information into sections and link them together.</p>                    

                    <img class="site-map" src="images/WS/site-map.png" alt="Site Map">
                    <p>Modeling a user-flow helped me understand how the navigation of site worked and if it met the target users' needs and business goals.</p>
                    <p>After working on my user flows, I started sketching different layouts on paper for content strategy and developed them into detailed wireframes using sketch.</p>
